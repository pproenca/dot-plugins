### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main. Collaboration agents share the parent checkout unless the parent creates separate worktrees. Before parallel writes, create one explicit worktree per branch and pass each owner its absolute path. The owner runs every command with that path as its working directory. Never assign two writers to one worktree. If the current checkout contains unrelated work or becomes snarled, preserve it and create a fresh worktree. Do not reset away existing changes.

**Commits.** Commit liberally; rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit; new commit when separable.

**PRs.** Inspect the diff for dead compatibility paths, unsupported guards, unrelated edits, and narrating comments before commit. Run **no-comments** before review. Write every PR title, description, and commit body with **technical-writing**, then apply **unslop**. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Apply the same `$pstack:technical-writing` and `$pstack:unslop` pass as the body. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it is empty.

- `## Why`. State the intent and why this approach fits.
- `## Scope`. State facts from the diff. Name real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out when the boundary matters.
- `## Tradeoffs`. State real choices only. Skip this section when there are none.
- `## Blast Radius`. State who and what the change touches. Explain why the change is safe or risky. If main is red without the fix, name the continuing cost.
- `## Verification`. State how you ran each check and its rigor. Name the real path, such as `control-cli`, a browser-control skill, computer-use, or the targeted tests. State the outcome of each check, not only the command name.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. Stack follow-ups with Graphite (`gt`), and keep the ordered stack visible to reviewers. Branch from main only for independent work. Rebase on `main` before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. Pass the ready-state option supported by the selected PR tool. If a PR still opens as a draft, run the host's ready command, such as `gh pr ready <number>`. Run `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR runs **interrogate**, **unslop**, and **no-comments**. It returns the URL and does not babysit. Return to the parent.
